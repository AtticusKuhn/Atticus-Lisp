# About
I have been fascinated a long time by [lisps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) such as [clojure](https://clojure.org/)
so I decided to make my own lisp. This lisp is called **Atticus Lisp**, and
is designed to be a simple lisp. This language is not done yet, and it is still
in development.
